You are the grim reaper. Everyone can see you.

They run away, but you need only touch them to collect thier souls,
to feel the weight of thier loss from this otherwise tranquil world
but it must be done says the narrator  

Then you meet a dog. He does not run away. 
His time has not come, when you touch him he doesn't float away

The dog helps you. The dog is good.

But eventually the dog must die. The narrator tells you he has lived a good life

You refuse. The narrator fades the screen. Another will come to take your place 
You touch the dog, one last time. Nothing Happens. The Screeen turns black. Roll Credits.
